sort1 uses: Bubble sort

How do you know?: Because in sorted input it showed better performace rather "sort3". As we know lower-bound of Bubble sort is Omega(n)

sort2 uses: Merge sort

How do you know?: Because it showed the best performance among all other sorting algorithms. Big O(n * log n)

sort3 uses: Selection sort

How do you know?: Because the performance almost the same for non-sorted and sorted inputs. Big O(n^2) as well as Omega(n^2)
